### Single-solution Based Metaheuristic Algorithms for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems: A Comparative Analysis

This repository contains code and documentation related to the analysis and solution of Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) using metaheuristic approaches. VRPs have emerged as a critical class of problems within combinatorial optimization due to the increasing volumes of goods movement spurred by globalization.

#### Problem Overview
The primary focus of this project is the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), a well-studied variant of VRPs. CVRP involves determining optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of customers while respecting vehicle capacity constraints.

#### Metaheuristic Approach
Given the computational complexity inherent in VRPs, traditional exact solving approaches are often impractical. Instead, this project employs metaheuristic algorithms, which utilize approximate methods to efficiently find solutions. Specifically, we concentrate on Single Solution Based metaheuristics, aiming to develop algorithms that construct metaheuristics based on this paradigm.

#### Contents
- **Code**: Implementation of metaheuristic modules that allows to build some metaheuristic algorithms for solving CVRP and some examples of built algorithms and codes of some tests written in python.
- **Thesis**: The master thesis work that contains more details about what there is in the codes deployed.
- **Files**: Input and output files achieved from the runs of some tests: Instances are input benchmark files for the tests, the tests directories contains various tests results.
